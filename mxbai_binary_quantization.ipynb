    "Our model was trained to have a non-'clunky' embeddings space. This allows for quantizing the embeddings with low performance loss compared to techniques like Matryoshka. With binary embeddings, we can use the Hamming distance, which is well optimized for CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the approach is divided into 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve candidates based on Hamming distance.\n",
    "2. Rescore the candidates based on the dot product between the binary embedding and the floating embedding of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that we can retain ~96-99% of the performance, achieve ~40x faster retrieval, and realize 32x storage savings."

This has cool applications for on-device usage, large-scale developments, etc. We should also explore its potential for other tasks, such as clustering and deduplication at scale."
